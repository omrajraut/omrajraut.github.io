                    <div class="paragraph-content">
                        Om Raj Raut, a shy teenager from a pocket of a mountain village in Nepal, dreamt of being a hero like the ones he saw in movies. He did not have the means to protect his village during the civil war, but he discovered his own kind of heroism on the small theatre stage while working on his first play, A Night with Mao. There, he found freedom to express himself, which felt like being a hero in its own way, just like he imagined when he was a child. With a passion for acting, he pursued his dreams in the United States, earning an International Dean's Scholarship for Drama and graduated from CCNY in theatre. 
                        Om's dedication and talent shone through in his solo show, 1953: Race for the Summit, which earned nominations for Best Actor at the New York Theater Festival, Best Dramatic Playwright at the Frigid New York Theatre Festival, and sold out shows at Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Om started his international journey at the Calcutta Theatre Festival, then performed in diverse productions in the US, from Off-Off-Off Broadway's "Pirate Christmas Carol" to AlfaNYC's "Ten Ways to Survive Life in Quarantine." He also led in "Our Lady of 121st Street," "The House of the Spirits," and "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at Tribeca Theatre Hall.
                        Om Raj has two short films circulating the festival circuit, including lead roles and writing credits in "A Distraction" and "Uncompleted." These films have been selected for screenings at prestigious festivals such as the British Film Festival, World Impact Festival, Nepal-America International Festival, and the 14th Pune Short Festival, where Om Raj has been recognized in the Best Actor category. On screen, Om Raj Raut thrives in exploring multifaceted personalities, delving into darker themes with depth and authenticity. He also brings versatility portraying a sweet friend, a supportive colleague, or a nerdy character deeply engrossed in their interests.
                        Om Raj shares his love for drama and writing as a teaching artist, nurturing the next generation of performers at Ping Chong Theatre where he helps to bring intrinsic human truth to productions through real-life incidents shared by non-actors.
                        Growing up in the Himalayas, he cherishes trekking and finds comfort amidst the peaks. The mountains taught him to appreciate himself, stay true to who he is, and push his limits. Om came to New York, a foreign land, with a desire to challenge himself and create opportunities. He knew no one but was determined to carve out his own path, just like the heroes he admired in movies.
